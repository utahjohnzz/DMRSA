Impingement Issues
A. Initialization of the humeral head
i. Reorientation (angular direction)
-- Assessing initial direction based on landmarks
-- Rotating landmarked direction to center
-- Overall difficulty in assessing and altering orientation
ii. Attempted Measures
-- Actual rotation based on a point and an axis of rotation is possible with Python, yet without the proper
placement of the axis of rotation, cannot do much
-- Blender may be of usage, yet still presents the same issues

B. Axis of Rotation
i. Location of axis
-- Placement of the axis based upon landmarks of the humeral head
-- Requires initilization
-- Placement of the glenosphere/scapula w.r.t. humeral rotational axis

ii. Attempted Measures
-- Using max Z and Y measures to locate the outline of hte humeral head and furthermore find the centroid
of the humeral head to locate the axis of rotational
-- Considured using statistical measures of locating the humeral head centroid
-- Usage of blender to locate the center of volume may be used, but was not able to single out zones of 
the humeral head rather than the entire STL in itself.

C. What is Actually Needed
-- Center of volume of only the humeral head
-- Standardized coordinate system applicable to every STL used to reorientate the humerus
-- Placement of the glenosphere/scapula w.r.t. humerus

Implantation Process
A. Resection
-- Cutting plane not successful in Blender
-- Various issues in manipulating STL geometry inside of Python but may be successful with correct initialization
of the humerus
